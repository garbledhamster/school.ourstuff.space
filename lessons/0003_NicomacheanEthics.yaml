  title: "Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics"
  description: >
    This course provides a comprehensive study of Aristotle’s *Nicomachean Ethics*, guiding
    students through his systematic account of human happiness (*eudaimonia*), moral virtue,
    rational deliberation, justice, friendship, pleasure, and the highest form of human
    flourishing over a fourteen-week semester. The course begins in Weeks 1–2 by
    establishing Aristotle’s foundational claims about the purpose of human life and the
    nature of moral virtue through close study of Books I–II, then moves in Weeks 3–4 to
    moral responsibility, voluntary action, and character formation in Books III–IV. In
    Weeks 5–6, students examine justice, law, and the social dimensions of ethics in Book V,
    followed in Weeks 7–8 by an in-depth exploration of intellectual virtue and practical
    wisdom (*phronesis*) in Book VI. Week 9 focuses on self-control, weakness of will, and
    the psychology of moral struggle in Book VII, while Weeks 10–11 address Aristotle’s
    extended treatment of friendship and its central role in a flourishing life through
    Books VIII–IX. The course concludes in Weeks 12–13 with Aristotle’s final synthesis on
    pleasure, contemplation, and the highest good in Book X, and culminates in Week 14 with
    integrative review and philosophical synthesis. Throughout the semester, students engage
    in close textual analysis, guided discussion, and applied reflection in order to
    understand Aristotle’s ethical system as a coherent philosophical vision that connects
    personal character development, rational judgment, social responsibility, and the
    pursuit of a meaningful and fulfilled human life.

      title: "Course Outline — Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics (14-week Semester)"
      course: |
        ## Overview
        This course is a close, systematic study of Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics across a fourteen-week semester. Students will read primary passages in translation, analyze Aristotle’s arguments, and practice applying Aristotelian concepts to cases of moral choice, civic responsibility, and personal development. The course emphasizes textual interpretation, conceptual clarity, and philosophical synthesis: how Aristotle connects human action, character, reason, and community to articulate a unified vision of the good life (eudaimonia).

        The structure moves from foundations (Books I–II) through responsibility and character (Books III–IV), social ethics and justice (Book V), intellectual virtues and practical wisdom (Book VI), psychology of moral struggle (Book VII), friendship and social goods (Books VIII–IX), and a final synthesis on pleasure and contemplation (Book X), finishing with integrative review. Weekly work combines reading, guided exercises, discussion prompts, and a substantive assignment to build interpretive and argumentative skill.

        **Key Takeaways**
        - Aristotle locates the highest human good in activity of the rational soul in accord with virtue (eudaimonia as flourishing).
        - Moral virtue is a learned, habituated mean between extremes, cultivated through practice and reason.
        - Practical wisdom (phronesis) integrates universal understanding and particular deliberation for right action.

        **Key Concepts**
        - Eudaimonia: a lifelong activity expressing excellence of the rational soul informed by moral and intellectual virtue.
        - Virtue as a mean: moral character achieved by habituation and reasoned choice between vices of excess and deficiency.
        - Phronesis (practical wisdom): intellectual virtue that guides moral deliberation in particular contexts.

        **Key Terms**
        - **Eudaimonia**: flourishing or human well-being as the highest practical good.
        - **Arete (Virtue)**: excellence of character or function, expressed in stable dispositions toward right action.
        - **Phronesis**: practical wisdom enabling right deliberation about means to goods in human life.
        - **Voluntary Action**: action performed with knowledge and without external compulsion; central to moral responsibility.

        COURSE GOALS
        - Develop close-reading skills and argumentative clarity in interpreting Aristotle’s texts.
        - Understand and explain Aristotle’s account of the highest good, moral and intellectual virtue, and practical reasoning.
        - Apply Aristotelian ethical principles to contemporary moral and civic questions.
        - Compare Aristotle’s ethical psychology with modern accounts of moral agency and weakness of will.
        - Cultivate students’ ability to write clear, well-structured analytic essays on ethical theory.

      title: "Summaries — Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics (Course Summary and Weekly Summaries)"
      course: |
        ## Overview
        This course is a close, systematic reading of Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics across fourteen weeks, combining sustained textual interpretation with conceptual analysis and applied reflection. Students move from Aristotle’s account of the highest human good and the nature of moral virtue to issues of responsibility, social ethics, intellectual virtue, moral psychology, friendship, and finally pleasure and contemplation, developing skills in close reading, argument reconstruction, and philosophical synthesis.

        **Key Takeaways**
        - Eudaimonia is activity of the rational soul in accord with excellence, realized across a whole life.
        - Moral virtue is acquired by habituation and guided by reason toward a mean between extremes.
        - Practical wisdom (phronesis) integrates universal understanding with particular deliberation for right action.

        **Key Concepts**
        - Eudaimonia as activity: flourishing as ongoing excellence, not a mere state or feeling.
        - Virtue as a mean: moral excellence as a reasoned disposition between excess and deficiency.
        - Phronesis (practical wisdom): intellectual virtue enabling sound deliberation about human goods.

        **Key Terms**
        - **Eudaimonia**: flourishing or human well-being understood as activity in accordance with virtue.
        - **Arete (Virtue)**: moral or intellectual excellence of character or function.
        - **Phronesis**: practical wisdom for choosing means to ends in particular circumstances.
        - **Akrasia (Weakness of Will)**: the phenomenon of acting against one’s better judgment through overpowering desire.

        ## Course Summary
        This fourteen-week seminar pursues a sustained engagement with Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics, emphasizing both close textual study and conceptual reconstruction. Beginning with Books I–II, we situate Aristotle’s project by asking what counts as the highest good and how moral virtue is formed through habituation and rational choice. The middle portion (Books III–VI) treats moral responsibility, voluntary action, character, justice, and intellectual virtues, with special attention to phronesis as the link between moral perception and action. Book VII’s psychological analyses deepen our understanding of akrasia, self-control, and pleasure; Books VIII–IX explore friendship as an essential social and moral good that shapes character and civic life. Book X synthesizes earlier claims by weighing pleasure, the contemplative life, and the unity of the good. Pedagogically, the course pairs close readings with discussion prompts, analytical exercises, and extended writing to develop interpretive accuracy and argumentative clarity so students can articulate and assess Aristotle’s ethical vision in historical and contemporary contexts.

We read Book I closely to trace Aristotle’s teleological method, his claim that every craft and action aims at some good, and his search for a final end — eudaimonia. Students will examine Aristotle’s proposal that the highest good is an activity of the soul in conformity with excellence, consider the role of the political science in determining the highest good, and practice close reading to locate premises and argumentative structure.

        **Key Takeaways**
        - Aristotle treats ethics as a practical inquiry: actions aim at goods, culminating in a highest good.
        - Eudaimonia is proposed as an activity in accordance with virtue, not merely a passive state.
        - Political inquiry is presented as the master art because it determines communal ends and the good life.

        **Key Concepts**
        - Teleology: explanations in terms of ends or purposes that things aim to realize.
        - Final end (telos): the ultimate aim for which other activities are pursued.
        - Activity in conformity with excellence: happiness as doing well according to virtues.

        **Key Terms**
        - **Eudaimonia**: flourishing or the highest human good, an activity expressing the soul’s excellence.
        - **Telos**: an end or purpose that explains why an activity or thing exists.
        - **Arete (Virtue)**: the excellence or quality that enables a thing to perform its function well.

      questions_and_answers:
        - Q: "What is Aristotle’s basic argument for why there must be a highest good?"
          A: "Aristotle argues that because the sciences, crafts, actions, and pursuits aim at various ends, and some ends are means to further ends, there must be a terminal or final end — a highest good — that is desired for itself and completes the sequence of aims."
        - Q: "How does Aristotle characterize eudaimonia in Book I?"
          A: "Aristotle characterizes eudaimonia as an activity of the soul in accordance with virtue (arete), implying a living, performing excellence rather than a mere possession or transient state."
        - Q: "Why does Aristotle call politics the ‘master art’ when discussing the highest good?"
          A: "Politics is called the master art because it orders and evaluates other arts and actions for the sake of the polis’ good; it defines and organizes communal ends, including those related to the good human life."

      title: "Book II — Moral Virtue as Habituation; Pleasure, Pain, and the Formation of Character"
      course: |
        ## Overview
        Aristotle's Book II argues that moral virtues are not innate intellectual states but dispositions formed by repeated action. Virtue, for Aristotle, is a settled disposition to choose the mean relative to us, arrived at through practice and habituation rather than mere instruction. This week emphasizes the contrast between moral and intellectual virtue, shows how pleasures and pains serve as trainers of character, and examines Aristotle's examples of how repeated choices shape perception, feeling, and desire. We read Book II closely alongside a short scholarly excerpt on habituation to evaluate Aristotle's claim that ethical excellence is cultivated by doing, so that right action becomes second nature.

        **Key Takeaways**
        - Moral virtues arise through habituation—repeated practice shapes character and practical perception of good.
        - Moral virtues differ from intellectual virtues; the former form through practice, the latter through teaching.
        - Pleasure and pain function as educational signals, reinforcing virtuous habituation and discouraging contrary actions.

        **Key Concepts**
        - Moral vs. intellectual virtue: moral virtue is formed by repeated action, intellectual virtue by instruction and reason.
        - Habituation (ethos): character shaped through repeated actions that make right responses easier and natural.
        - The role of pleasure and pain: affective responses guide agents toward or away from virtuous patterns of action.

        **Key Terms**
        - **Moral virtue**: a stable disposition to choose the mean and act excellently in emotions and actions.
        - **Intellectual virtue**: excellence of reasoning and understanding developed through teaching and study.
        - **Habituation**: the process by which repeated actions form character and make virtuous choices habitual.

      sources:
        - "Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, Book II (primary reading)"
        - "Secondary: Excerpt on virtue as habituation (scholarly selection; short article or chapter excerpt)"
        - "Recommended: Selected translations and commentary notes (e.g., Barnes or Owens introductions to Book II)"

      questions_and_answers:
        - Q: "How does Aristotle distinguish moral virtue from intellectual virtue in Book II?"
          A: "Aristotle explains that moral virtues are acquired by habituation—formed through repeated actions and shaped by pleasure and pain—whereas intellectual virtues arise from teaching, time, and experience involving the rational part of the soul."
        - Q: "Why does Aristotle emphasize pleasure and pain in moral education?"
          A: "Pleasure and pain train the appetitive part of the soul by making certain actions feel right or wrong; repeated actions paired with appropriate pleasures and pains make virtuous responses more natural."
        - Q: "What is Aristotle's basic argument that virtues are formed by habit rather than being innate?"
          A: "He argues from observation and analogy: skills and tastes develop through practice, and because moral excellence shows similar patterns of improvement via repetition, virtues must also be cultivated by doing virtuous acts until they become dispositions."

      title: "Voluntary Action, Choice, and Moral Responsibility (Book III)"
      course: |
        ## Overview
        Understanding voluntary and involuntary action is central to Aristotle's moral theory because responsibility, praise, and blame presuppose a distinction between actions done from the agent's own deliberative choice and those caused by external compulsion or ignorance. In Book III Aristotle introduces prohairesis (choice) as a rational appetite formed through prior deliberation; he distinguishes voluntary, involuntary, and non-voluntary actions and examines how ignorance, force, and passion affect moral assessment. This week we track how deliberation links means and ends, how character forms through repeated chosen acts, and why Aristotle’s account matters for attributing praise, blame, and legal responsibility.

        **Key Takeaways**
        - Voluntary actions arise from the agent with knowledge of particulars and without external compulsion.
        - Choice (prohairesis) is a rational, deliberated desire directed at means toward ends.
        - Ignorance or compulsion can mitigate moral blame but require careful specification.

        **Key Concepts**
        - Voluntariness: the agent's origin and knowledge determine moral responsibility and praise/blame.
        - Prohairesis (choice): a rational, deliberated selection of means consistent with ends and character.
        - Deliberation: practical reasoning about means that grounds choice and moral agency.

        **Key Terms**
        - **Voluntary action**: action originating in the agent with awareness of particular circumstances.
        - **Prohairesis (choice)**: the rational, deliberated desire for means that expresses moral character.

      sources:
        - "Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, Book III (sections on voluntariness, choice, and responsibility) — W. D. Ross translation or equivalent"
        - "Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, entry 'Aristotle's Ethics' — section on voluntary action and choice (secondary commentary)"

      questions_and_answers:
        - Q: "What distinguishes a voluntary action from an involuntary action for Aristotle?"
          A: "A voluntary action originates in the agent and is done with awareness of particular circumstances, whereas an involuntary action is caused by force or followed by regret due to ignorance of particulars."
        - Q: "Why does Aristotle insist that choice requires deliberation?"
          A: "Choice (prohairesis) selects means toward ends; because means are contingent and variable, deliberation about particulars is required to form a reasoned selection."
        - Q: "How can ignorance or compulsion affect moral praise and blame?"
          A: "Ignorance about particulars or actions under external compulsion can mitigate blame; but voluntary negligence or self-induced ignorance can still attract responsibility."

      title: "Particular Moral Virtues: Courage, Temperance, and Magnanimity (Book IV)"
      course: |
        ## Overview
        In Week 4 we turn to Aristotle's detailed treatment of particular moral virtues in Book IV, focusing on courage, temperance, liberality, magnificence, and magnanimity. We study how each virtue is characterized as a mean between excess and deficiency, how dispositions are shaped by habituation and rational choice, and how social contexts (honor, wealth, public expenditure) shape the expression of those virtues. Attention will also be given to how voluntariness and prohairesis inform praise and blame when agents cultivate or fail to cultivate these dispositions.

        **Key Takeaways**
        - Virtues in Book IV are specific means between excess and deficiency, realized in feeling and action.
        - Magnanimity concerns rightly deserved honor and the soul’s proper estimation of its worth.
        - Social roles and material conditions affect how virtues like liberality and magnificence manifest.

        **Key Concepts**
        - The mean: practical reason locates a stable intermediate stance between two harmful extremes.
        - Prohairesis and voluntariness: responsible choice links deliberation to stable character traits.
        - Social expression of virtue: honor, wealth, and public life shape virtues’ outward forms.

        **Key Terms**
        - **Mean**: the intermediate state between excess and deficiency, determined by right reason.
        - **Magnanimity**: greatness of soul; proper self-regard tied to deserved honor.
        - **Temperance**: moderation in bodily pleasures, especially sexual and gustatory desires.

      sources:
        - "Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, Book IV (primary text: courage, temperance, liberality, magnificence, magnanimity)"
        - "Secondary: Lecture notes on moral exemplars and classical Greek social practices affecting virtue"
        - "Secondary readings: scholarly commentary on magnanimity and honor in Book IV (selected excerpts)"

      questions_and_answers:
        - Q: "How does Aristotle characterize the 'mean' for a particular virtue in Book IV?"
          A: "Aristotle describes the mean as a disposition to feel and act at the right times, with respect to the right things, and toward the right people; practical wisdom determines the appropriate intermediate between excess and deficiency."
        - Q: "In what way is magnanimity tied to honor, and why is it distinctive among virtues?"
          A: "Magnanimity concerns a correct estimation of one’s worth relative to honor; unlike other virtues focused on pleasures or actions, it centrally involves reputation and deserved recognition in social life."
        - Q: "How do voluntariness and prohairesis bear on moral praise for virtuous acts discussed in Book IV?"
          A: "Virtuous acts receive praise when they stem from voluntary choice (prohairesis) and stable dispositions; ignorance, compulsion, or bad deliberation can mitigate praise or blame even when outward acts resemble virtue."

      title: "Justice and Proportionality — Nicomachean Ethics Book V"
      course: |
        ## Overview
        Aristotle's Book V investigates justice as the central virtue for social and political life. He distinguishes kinds of justice—political, legal, distributive, and corrective—and shows how each responds to different relations among citizens and the community. Central to his account is proportionality: fairness requires distributing honors, goods, and burdens according to merit or relevant measure rather than strict arithmetic equality. This week we read Book V closely, compare Aristotle's categories with modern intuitions about equality and rights, and trace how habituation and moral psychology shape just action in civic contexts.

        **Key Takeaways**
        - Aristotle distinguishes distributive and corrective justice to address different social imbalances.
        - Proportionality governs fair allocation by relating shares to relevant merit or measure.
        - Justice in the polis integrates law, equity, and collective well-being through practical reasoning.

        **Key Concepts**
        - Distinction between distributive and corrective justice and their respective normative aims.
        - Proportionality principle: justice allocates according to merit, not strict numerical equality.
        - Political and legal justice as expressions of communal norms and corrective mechanisms.

        **Key Terms**
        - **Distributive justice**: allocation of honors and resources according to merit or proportion.
        - **Corrective justice**: restoration after transactions or wrongful acts to restore balance.
        - **Proportionality**: principle that allocative shares should reflect relevant differences or merit.

      sources:
        - "Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, Book V (Justice) — primary text"
        - "Selected secondary readings on distributive and corrective justice (course reader): articles on proportionality, equality, and legal justice"
        - "Excerpt: Ronna Burger, \"Aristotle's Politics and Ethics: The Place of Justice\" (selected pages)"

      questions_and_answers:
        - Q: "How does Aristotle distinguish distributive from corrective justice?"
          A: "Distributive justice concerns allocation of honors and resources according to proportionate merit, while corrective justice addresses voluntary or involuntary transactions and seeks to restore equality after a wrong or imbalance."
        - Q: "What role does proportionality play in Aristotle’s account of fairness?"
          A: "Proportionality ensures that shares correspond to relevant measures (merit, contribution) rather than identical numerical equality, making distribution sensitive to relevant differences among persons."
        - Q: "How might habituation and pleasure/pain conditioning influence just action in civic contexts?"
          A: "Habituation shapes dispositions toward fairness; pleasure and pain reinforce actions aligned or misaligned with justice, so citizens trained to take pleasure in fairness are more likely to act justly."

      title: "Law, Equity (Epieikeia), and the Judge’s Role — Book V continued"
      course: |
        ## Overview
        In Week 6 we complete Book V and focus tightly on Aristotle’s account of law, equity (epieikeia), and the judicial function. Aristotle distinguishes the generality and necessity that characterize law from the sensitivity to particulars that equity supplies; where law treats cases by general rule, equity corrects when rigid rules produce injustice in specific circumstances. We examine how judges must balance respect for statutory generality with the moral imperative to correct for exceptions, and how concepts of voluntariness, ignorance, and proportionality inform judgments about blame and appropriate remedies.

        **Key Takeaways**
        - Law provides necessary general rules; equity corrects when particular cases require humane adjustment.
        - Judges must interpret legal rules with judgment, bridging universal standards and concrete facts.
        - Proportionality and voluntariness shape assessments of justice, responsibility, and corrective measures.

        **Key Concepts**
        - The distinction between law’s generality and equity’s attention to particular circumstances and fairness.
        - The judge’s role as mediator who applies rules but may correct for cases where rules fail.
        - Corrective and distributive concerns converge in proportional remedies responsive to facts and merit.

        **Key Terms**
        - **Epieikeia (equity)**: the corrective principle that tempers general laws to fit particular unjust cases.
        - **Corrective justice**: restoration that makes parties equal after wrongdoing through appropriate compensation.
        - **Proportionality**: matching benefits or burdens to relevant measures, especially in distributive allocations.

      questions_and_answers:
        - Q: "What is the core difference between law and equity (epieikeia) in Aristotle’s account?"
          A: "Law issues general, necessary rules aimed at broad correctness; equity is the corrective practice that adjusts those rules when their generality produces manifest unfairness in particular cases."
        - Q: "How does Aristotle connect voluntariness and ignorance to legal responsibility?"
          A: "Aristotle treats voluntary actions as the proper subject of praise or blame, while ignorance and compulsion can mitigate culpability; judges assess whether ignorance was culpable or excusable when allocating corrective remedies."
        - Q: "Why does proportionality matter for distributive and corrective justice?"
          A: "Proportionality ensures that allocations and remedies correspond to relevant measures of merit, loss, or blame so that justice restores or distributes in accordance with relevant comparative ratios."

      title: "Book VI — Intellectual Virtues and Phronesis (Practical Wisdom)"
      course: |
        ## Overview

        This week focuses on Aristotle's Book VI, which distinguishes intellectual virtues (techne, episteme, phronesis, sophia) and places practical wisdom (phronesis) at the center of ethical action. We read how phronesis integrates moral virtue with correct deliberation: it discerns particulars, weighs competing goods, and guides choice toward the good life (eudaimonia). Attention will be given to how intellectual knowledge differs from know-how and theoretical wisdom, and to the interdependence of moral character and practical reasoning in producing right action.

        We will combine close textual reading of Book VI with contemporary secondary sources that illuminate the nature, teachability, and cultivation of phronesis in modern practical contexts (law, medicine, leadership). Class activities emphasize applying phronesis to concrete moral problems and distinguishing it from other forms of cognitive excellence.

        **Key Takeaways**
        - Phronesis is a moral intellectual virtue that links right deliberation to right action in particular circumstances.
        - Techne and episteme are forms of know-how and scientific knowledge distinct from practical wisdom’s moral judgment.
        - Cultivating phronesis requires experience, habituation, and reflection rather than purely theoretical instruction.

        **Key Concepts**
        - Practical reasoning: deliberation about means for living well oriented by moral ends and particular circumstances.
        - The unity of virtue: phronesis coordinates moral virtues so actions are both right in feeling and in reasoning.
        - Moral perception of particulars: phronesis discerns salient features that rule-based knowledge cannot fully capture.

        **Key Terms**
        - **Phronesis (practical wisdom)**: the intellectual virtue enabling correct deliberation about actions aimed at the good life.
        - **Techne (craft/technique)**: productive knowledge concerned with making things and following rules for predictable results.
        - **Episteme (scientific knowledge)**: demonstrative, theoretical knowledge of universals and necessary truths.
        - **Sophia (theoretical wisdom)**: the combination of episteme and nous oriented toward first principles and truth.

      sources:
        - "Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, Book VI (recommended translation: W.D. Ross or Terence Irwin), primary text"
        - "Martha C. Nussbaum, 'Non-Relative Virtues: An Aristotelian Approach' (1990), on phronesis and moral reason"
        - "Julia Annas, Intelligent Virtue (excerpts: chapter on practical reason and moral perception), secondary"
        - "Alasdair MacIntyre, After Virtue (selected excerpts on practical reasoning and tradition), secondary"

      questions_and_answers:
        - Q: "How does Aristotle distinguish phronesis from techne and episteme?"
          A: "Aristotle distinguishes them by purpose and method: techne is productive know-how concerned with making, episteme is theoretical knowledge of universals, while phronesis is practical wisdom aimed at right action, deliberating about means in contingent human affairs and shaped by moral ends."
        - Q: "Is phronesis teachable according to Aristotle?"
          A: "Aristotle suggests phronesis is not teachable in the same way as techne or episteme; it develops through habituation, experience, and guided deliberation, though mentoring and practical instruction can cultivate conditions for its growth."
        - Q: "What role does perception of particulars play in practical wisdom?"
          A: "Phronesis requires sensitivity to particulars: it discerns relevant features in situations that universal rules may not capture, allowing flexible, context-sensitive judgement."

      exercises:
        - name: "Retrieval Exercise (Easy)"
          prompt: >
            Without notes, list and briefly explain the following concepts: judicial discretion

            relevant moral principles, weigh consequences and intentions, and justify a choice that
            balances moral ends with practical means. Provide a paragraph of deliberation and a
            concluding sentence with your recommended action.

            Scenario: A municipal official must decide whether to issue an immediate mandatory

      title: "Teaching Practical Wisdom: Phronesis, Experience, and Deliberation"
      course: |
        ## Overview
        This week advances our study of Book VI by focusing on the pedagogy of intellectual virtue, especially phronesis (practical wisdom). We examine how experience, habituation, mentorship, and reflective exercises combine to form reliable moral judgment able to navigate particular situations. Emphasis is placed on classroom and apprenticeship practices that cultivate perceptual sensitivity to particulars, the capacity to deliberate about means, and the communal contexts that support moral formation. Students will analyze textual passages, compare pedagogical models, and design applied exercises intended to develop phronetic judgment in real-world learning environments.

        **Key Takeaways**
        - Phronesis integrates perception of particulars with deliberative reasoning to select virtuous means.
        - Experience, habituation, and mentorship jointly convert moral knowledge into reliable practical judgment.
        - Classroom and communal practices must provide situated cases and guided reflection to cultivate phronesis.

        **Key Concepts**
        - Distinguishing techne, episteme, sophia, and phronesis clarifies different intellectual aims relevant to action.
        - Moral perception of particulars is necessary for applying universal principles in concrete deliberation.
        - Reflective practice and feedback bridge episodic experience and stable practical wisdom.

        **Key Terms**
        - **Phronesis**: practical wisdom — the moral intellect that discerns right ends and means in context.
        - **Techne**: craft or skill-based know-how oriented toward producing particular artifacts or outcomes.
        - **Episteme**: theoretical or scientific knowledge concerned with necessary and universal truths.

        - "Martha Nussbaum, The Fragility of Goodness (1986) — selections on practical reasoning and contingency"

      questions_and_answers:
        - Q: "How does Aristotle conceive the role of experience in cultivating phronesis?"
          A: "For Aristotle, experience supplies a repertoire of particular cases and perceptual sensitivity; combined with habituation and reflective judgment, it allows one to recognize morally relevant features and deliberate about appropriate means."
        - Q: "What distinguishes phronesis from techne, episteme, and sophia?"
          A: "Techne is productive skill for making things, episteme is demonstrable theoretical knowledge, sophia is contemplative wisdom about first principles, while phronesis is practical, moral reason aimed at right action in particular contexts."
        - Q: "What classroom methods best reveal whether a student is developing phronesis?"
          A: "Case-based simulations, supervised practicum with real decisions, reflective journals linking choices to reasons, and mentor feedback sessions reveal the student's ability to perceive particulars and deliberate rightly."

      title: "Book VII — Akrasia, Self-Control, and the Psychology of Moral Struggle"
      course: |
        ## Overview
        In Week 9 we read Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, Book VII, closely examining akrasia (weakness of will), enkrateia (self-control/continence), and the role of pleasure and appetite in shaping action. We track Aristotle's distinctions among voluntary action, choice, and ignorance, and his attempt to give a psychological account of why agents sometimes act against their better judgment. The week connects Aristotle's conceptual analysis to contemporary empirical studies on impulsivity, decision-making, and habit, asking whether his account remains plausible as a normative-psychological model of moral failure.

        **Key Takeaways**
        - Akrasia describes acting against reason when passion overwhelms deliberative judgment.
        - Enkrateia (self-control) enables agents to align appetites with rational choice consistently.
        - Pleasure functions as a trainer for the soul, explaining repeated patterns of desire and action.

        **Key Concepts**
        - Distinguishing akrasia, vice, and ignorance to explain different forms of morally flawed action.
        - The psychology of temptation: how appetite, perception, and memory disrupt deliberation and choice.
        - Role of habituation in stabilizing character, thereby reducing susceptibility to akratic episodes.

        **Key Terms**
        - **Akrasia**: weakness of will; acting against better judgment due to overpowering desires.
        - **Enkrateia**: self-control or continence; the state of having appetites aligned with reason.
        - **Hedone (Pleasure)**: affective response that reinforces habits and motivates repeated action.

      sources:
        - "Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, Book VII (primary: translation by W. D. Ross or similar)"
        - "Annas, J., & Sorabji, R., selections on akrasia and moral psychology (secondary readings)"
        - "Contemporary psychology: research on akrasia, impulse control, and decision-making (e.g., articles on impulsivity, dual-process models, and habit formation)"

      questions_and_answers:
        - Q: "How does Aristotle distinguish akrasia from vice and from simple ignorance?"
          A: "Aristotle says akrasia occurs when one knows the better course but is overcome by desire; vice involves defective reasoning that takes pleasure in the wrong, while ignorance lacks the relevant knowledge or perception of the good."
        - Q: "Why does Aristotle think pleasure can explain why someone acts against their better judgment?"
          A: "He argues pleasure can seize attention and memory, altering perception and motivation so that immediate pleasurable appearances override deliberative judgments about what is truly good."
        - Q: "What difference does habituation make in reducing akratic actions?"
          A: "Habituation shapes desires and emotional responses over time, creating stable appetites that either support rational choice (through training) or perpetuate akratic tendencies if mistrained."

      title: "Friendship (Philia) — Types, Value, and Political Dimensions (Book VIII)"
      course: |
        ## Overview
        This week centers on Aristotle’s account of friendship (philia) in Book VIII of the Nicomachean Ethics. We trace his taxonomy—friendships of utility, pleasure, and virtue—and attend to how each form contributes differently to individual flourishing. Beyond private relations, Aristotle situates friendship within the polis: friendships shape civic bonds, trust, and stability, and virtuous friendships serve as models for laws and political association. We examine how friendships habituate moral dispositions, support practical reasoning (phronesis), and mediate conflicts between personal and public goods.

        **Key Takeaways**
        - Aristotle distinguishes three kinds of friendship: utility, pleasure, and virtue, each with distinct durability and moral value.
        - Virtuous friendships reciprocally promote moral development and reinforce practical wisdom through shared ends.
        - Friendship has political import: stable friendships contribute to civic cohesion and the moral fabric of the polis.

        **Key Concepts**
        - Friendship as reciprocal goodwill directed at the good of the friend, rooted in mutual recognition and likeness.
        - The role of habituation and shared practices in stabilizing character and making friendship morally formative.
        - The distinction between private personal friendship and friendships that underpin civic institutions and laws.

        **Key Terms**
        - **Philia**: Greek term for friendship or affectionate regard, encompassing multiple relational forms.
        - **Virtue Friendship**: A mutual relationship based on shared pursuit of the good and moral excellence.
        - **Civic Friendship**: Relationships and practices that bind citizens together, supporting political stability and justice.

        - "Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, Book VIII (primary text; recommended translation: W.D. Ross or Terence Irwin)"
        - "Michael Pakaluk, selected essays on Aristotle's ethics and friendship (secondary readings)"
        - "Martha C. Nussbaum, selections from The Fragility of Goodness and essays on social goods and interpersonal ethics"
        - "Selected contemporary articles on friendship, social goods, and political stability (provided in course reader)"

      questions_and_answers:
        - Q: "What are the three types of friendship Aristotle identifies, and how do they differ?"
          A: "Aristotle identifies friendships of utility (mutual benefit), pleasure (mutual enjoyment), and virtue (mutual regard for the good). Utility and pleasure friendships are often temporary and contingent on external goods or enjoyment; virtuous friendships are durable, based on mutual moral excellence and concern for the friend's flourishing."
        - Q: "How does Aristotle connect friendship to the development of moral character?"
          A: "Friendships provide contexts for habituation, imitation, and moral encouragement. Virtuous friends reciprocally promote good actions, reinforce dispositions, and furnish opportunities for phronesis—practical reasoning about particulars—thereby stabilizing moral character."
        - Q: "In what way does Aristotle think friendships matter for political life?"
          A: "Aristotle holds that friendships underpin social bonds and trust necessary for civic cooperation; friendships patterned on virtue help form laws and practices that cultivate citizens' character, supporting unity and political stability."

      title: "Friendship Continued: Self-Love, Civic Bonds, and the Political Dimensions of Philia"
      course: |
        ## Overview
        Aristotle’s treatment of friendship in Book IX develops the account from Book VIII by exploring self-love, reciprocity, and how intimate bonds scale into political relationships that sustain civic life. This week we read Book IX closely to see how proper self-love (not selfishness) undergirds virtuous friendship, how friends mirror and perfect one another’s moral character, and how such interpersonal goods contribute to trust, justice, and the common good in the polis. We will also interrogate tensions between partial private attachments and the impartial requirements of political friendship.

        **Key Takeaways**
        - Proper self-love aligns one’s concern for oneself with virtuous activity and benefits friends and community.
        - Virtuous friendships cultivate moral character, reinforce phronesis, and stabilize dispositions through mutual correction.
        - Civic or political friendship extends private goodwill into social institutions, supporting trust, justice, and the common good.

        **Key Concepts**
        - Self-love as a source of moral motivation that must be ordered toward virtue and communal flourishing.
        - Distinction among friendships of utility, pleasure, and virtue, and their differing civic significance.
        - Political friendship as public-minded reciprocity that binds citizens in shared aims and stable institutions.

        **Key Terms**
        - **philia**: Aristotle’s term for friendship or affectionate bonds among people.
        - **self-love (proper)**: caring for oneself in ways ordered to virtue and communal flourishing.
        - **political friendship**: civic bonds and reciprocal goodwill that contribute to the polis and common good.

      questions_and_answers:
        - Q: "How does Aristotle reconcile self-love with altruistic friendship in Book IX?"
          A: "Aristotle distinguishes proper self-love—seeking one’s own good by pursuing virtue—from selfishness. Proper self-love leads one to value virtuous friends because their good supports one’s own flourishing; thus self-regard and concern for friends align rather than conflict."
        - Q: "What are the key differences between friendships of utility, pleasure, and virtue, especially in political contexts?"
          A: "Friendships of utility and pleasure are contingent and often short-lived; they serve individual benefit. Virtue-friendships are enduring, mutual, and focused on good character. Politically, virtue-friendships foster trust and shared aims, while utility/pleasure ties can contribute instrumentally but less reliably to civic cohesion."
        - Q: "In what ways does Aristotle think friendships contribute to the polis and common good?"
          A: "Aristotle argues friendships create reciprocal goodwill, stabilize social relations, and habituate citizens toward justice and mutual assistance; when extended politically, these bonds support institutions, encourage lawful cooperation, and make collective life more flourishing."

      title: "Book X — Pleasure, Contemplation, and the Highest Life"
      course: |
        ## Overview
        In Book X Aristotle brings his ethical project to a culmination by examining the role of pleasure and the nature of the best life. He argues that pleasure properly completes virtuous activity without being its essence, and then advances a sustained case for contemplative activity (theoria) as the highest, most self-sufficient exercise of the rational part of the soul. This week emphasizes close reading of Book X passages that connect pleasure, virtue, and intellectual activity, and it situates Aristotle’s contemplative ideal against secondary views that prioritize political or active lives.

        **Key Takeaways**
        - Contemplation (theoria) is the most continuous, self-sufficient activity and thus closest to eudaimonia.
        - Pleasure accompanies and perfects activity when it naturally follows a virtuous exercise.
        - Theoria’s superiority rests on reason’s highest function and intellectual autonomy.

        **Key Concepts**
        - Theoria as the pure exercise of the intellect, continuous and self-contained, comprising the highest human activity.
        - Pleasure as accompaniment: not the aim of virtue, but a natural completion of excellent activity.
        - The relation between political/active life and contemplative life: compatibility, priority, and human social goods.

        **Key Terms**
        - **Theoria**: contemplative, intellectual activity focused on truth and understanding.
        - **Eudaimonia**: flourishing or the good life achieved by virtuous and rational activity.
        - **Pleasure**: an accompaniment that completes activity when it fits the activity’s nature.

      sources:
        - "Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, Book X (primary passages on pleasure and contemplation) — recommended translation: W.D. Ross or Terence Irwin."
        - "Martha C. Nussbaum, The Fragility of Goodness (selections on external goods and the best life)."
        - "Richard Kraut, Aristotle on the Human Good (chapters on Book X and the contemplative life)."
        - "Sarah Broadie, Ethics with Aristotle (essays contrasting the active and contemplative ideals)."

      questions_and_answers:
        - Q: "Why does Aristotle privilege contemplative activity (theoria) as the highest form of human life?"
          A: "Aristotle argues that theoria exercises the highest part of the soul (reason) in a continuous, self-sufficient way, aims at truth for its own sake, and yields the most enduring form of pleasure tied to intellectual activity; therefore it best expresses human function and eudaimonia."
        - Q: "How does Aristotle reconcile pleasure with virtuous action in Book X?"
          A: "He treats pleasure as a natural completion of activity: when an activity is excellent, the pleasure that naturally accompanies it perfects rather than corrupts it, distinguishing good pleasures aligned with virtue from base, corrupting pleasures."
        - Q: "Can the contemplative ideal be reconciled with civic or political engagement?"
          A: "Aristotle allows that political activity has value and that many people achieve eudaimonia through practical, social life; however, he grants contemplative life priority in terms of excellence and self-sufficiency while not wholly dismissing the moral importance of civic activity."

      title: "Synthesis: Contemplation, Friendship, and the Highest Good"
      course: |
        ## Overview
        This week brings together Aristotle’s account of eudaimonia by synthesizing the moral and intellectual virtues, the role of practical wisdom (phronesis), the structure and civic importance of friendship (philia), and Book X’s prioritization of contemplative life. We consider how pleasures properly complete activity, how habits and friendships cultivate phronesis, and how public institutions and equitable judgment support individual flourishing.

        We also address tensions Aristotle recognizes: the high valuation of theoria versus the undeniable social and political goods of active life; the corrective role of equity in applying rules to particulars; and how contemplation and civic engagement can be integrated into a practicable ideal of the good life.
        **Key Takeaways**
        - Aristotle unites moral and intellectual virtues through phronesis, which guides right action toward eudaimonia.
        - Friendship habituates and sustains virtue, providing moral contexts that develop and exercise phronesis.
        - Contemplative activity ranks highest, yet active civic goods and pleasures properly complete virtuous life.
        **Key Concepts**
        - Phronesis integrates reasoned deliberation with character to select means and ends constitutive of flourishing.
        - Pleasure complements virtuous activity when it naturally follows excellence without becoming its primary aim.
        - Epieikeia (equity) and judicial discretion reconcile universal rules with particular cases in practical judgment.
        **Key Terms**
        - **theoria**: contemplative activity directed at truth and intellectual excellence, highest exercise of the intellect.
        - **phronesis**: practical wisdom that coordinates moral feeling and deliberation to choose the mean and act well.
        - **epieikeia**: equity; corrective judgment that modifies general law to fit particular circumstances.

      sources:
        - "Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, Book X (primary text; any standard translation)"
        - "Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, Books I–IX (cross-reference to virtues, friendship, phronesis)"
        - "Secondary: Martha Nussbaum, 'Aristotle on Human Nature and Political Life' (comparative discussion on flourishing)"
        - "Secondary: Julia Annas, 'The Morality of Happiness' (on unity of moral and intellectual virtues)"
        - "Secondary: Short comparative piece on contemporary accounts of flourishing (journal article)"

      questions_and_answers:
        - Q: "How does Aristotle reconcile the priority of contemplation with the value of civic life?"
          A: "Aristotle privileges contemplation as the most self-sufficient, continuous, and divine-like activity, yet recognizes civic and practical goods as important components of a full life; political activity supplies external goods and moral contexts necessary for developing virtue and sustaining the contemplative life."
        - Q: "What role does pleasure play in virtuous activity according to Book X?"
          A: "Pleasure is a natural completion of activity: when activity is well-executed, pleasure accompanies it without undermining excellence; it is not the essence of virtue but confirms and enhances functioning."
        - Q: "Why is equity (epieikeia) important for practical judgment?"
          A: "Equity corrects the rigidity of universal rules by allowing discretion that attends to particulars, enabling judges and agents to apply justice when legal formulations fail to capture exceptional circumstances."

      title: "Week 14 — Integrative Synthesis: Aristotle’s Ethical Vision in Practice"
      course: |
        ## Overview
        In Week 14 we move from close reading to integrative synthesis, drawing together Aristotle’s central claims about eudaimonia, moral and intellectual virtues, friendship, pleasure, and the role of political life. Students will review key passages from Books I–X, consolidate notes, and prepare sustained oral and written syntheses that connect textual analysis with contemporary ethical problems. Emphasis is on demonstrating how phronesis (practical wisdom) unifies moral character and deliberation, how contemplation and civic activity interrelate, and how friendships habituate and enable virtuous action in communities.

        **Key Takeaways**
        - Synthesize how phronesis unites moral virtue and correct action in a flourishing life.
        - Show how contemplative and active goods complement each other for full eudaimonia.
        - Explain friendship's formative role in habituation, trust, and political cohesion.

        **Key Concepts**
        - Practical wisdom (phronesis) functions as situational reason connecting virtue and action.
        - Theoria and civic activity coexist: contemplation prioritized but complemented by public goods.
        - Friendship types differ in stability and contribute differently to individual and civic flourishing.

        **Key Terms**
        - **Phronesis**: practical wisdom enabling right deliberation and action in particular situations.
        - **Theoria**: contemplative activity, the highest exercise of intellect and source of supreme happiness.
        - **Philia**: friendship or mutual goodwill, essential to moral development and communal life.

      sources:
        - "Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, Books I–X (selected passages for review: I.7, II.1–6, III–IV on voluntariness and virtue, V on justice, VI on phronesis, VII on akrasia, VIII–IX on friendship, X on pleasure and theoria)."

        - "Secondary readings compiled by instructor: articles on phronesis, civic friendship, and contemporary applications (available on course site)."

      questions_and_answers:
        - Q: "How does phronesis unify moral and intellectual virtues in Aristotle's account?"
          A: "Phronesis is the practical intellectual virtue that grasps particulars and deliberates well about ends and means, thereby linking moral dispositions (hexis) to correct action; it integrates moral virtue's stable character with rational guidance in specific situations."
        - Q: "In preparing a final synthesis, how should one balance the priority of contemplation with the value of civic activity?"
          A: "A strong synthesis acknowledges Aristotle's preference for theoria while showing that political and active goods remain integral to a full human life: contemplation is highest in excellence, but flourishing often requires friendships, civic roles, and practical goods for completeness."
        - Q: "What role do friendships play in cultivating phronesis and sustaining political communities?"
          A: "Friendships, especially those centered on virtue, habituate individuals to reciprocal goodwill and deliberative practices, strengthening moral dispositions and fostering trust and cooperation that underpin civic stability and collective flourishing."
