  title: "Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics"
  description: >
    This course provides a comprehensive study of Aristotle’s *Nicomachean Ethics*, guiding
    students through his systematic account of human happiness (*eudaimonia*), moral virtue,
    rational deliberation, justice, friendship, pleasure, and the highest form of human
    flourishing over a fourteen-week semester. The course begins in Weeks 1–2 by
    establishing Aristotle’s foundational claims about the purpose of human life and the
    nature of moral virtue through close study of Books I–II, then moves in Weeks 3–4 to
    moral responsibility, voluntary action, and character formation in Books III–IV. In
    Weeks 5–6, students examine justice, law, and the social dimensions of ethics in Book V,
    followed in Weeks 7–8 by an in-depth exploration of intellectual virtue and practical
    wisdom (*phronesis*) in Book VI. Week 9 focuses on self-control, weakness of will, and
    the psychology of moral struggle in Book VII, while Weeks 10–11 address Aristotle’s
    extended treatment of friendship and its central role in a flourishing life through
    Books VIII–IX. The course concludes in Weeks 12–13 with Aristotle’s final synthesis on
    pleasure, contemplation, and the highest good in Book X, and culminates in Week 14 with
    integrative review and philosophical synthesis. Throughout the semester, students engage
    in close textual analysis, guided discussion, and applied reflection in order to
    understand Aristotle’s ethical system as a coherent philosophical vision that connects
    personal character development, rational judgment, social responsibility, and the
    pursuit of a meaningful and fulfilled human life.
